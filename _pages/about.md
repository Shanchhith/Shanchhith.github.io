**Hobbies and Interests**

When I’m not working, I love reading non-fiction and historical books.  One of my favorite quotes that keeps me motivated is:
*"If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward."* – Martin Luther King Jr.
